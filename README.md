This plugin adds a dock to the bottom of the screen. Similar to what you would see in Unity or Unreal. It allows you to preview assets and drag them into the scene.

# Settings
Settings can be found in addons/asset_dock you can configure the following settings

root_folder_path - This is the root file path of Asset Dock it will load all files in this directory and any files in folders
file_types - An array of file types that will be displayed in the dock if empty all file types will be shown
hide_empty_folders - If true empty folders will not be shown in the dock

If you want to adjust the resolution of thumbnails in the dock do the following.
Go to Editor->Docks->Filesystem there you can adjust the size of preview thumbnails by default it's set to 64
